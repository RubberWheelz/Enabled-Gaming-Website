# Enabled-Gaming-Website

## OVERVIEW/BACKGROUND

The problem I see that needs to be fixed is accessibility in the gaming world. Being disabled myself and seeing
the issues arise as I play my games is a cause for concern and an issue that is near to my heart. The
issue of accessibility in games is a significant concern that has gained more attention in recent years. Many
games are designed without considering the diverse needs of players with disabilities, which can lead to
exclusion and frustration. One of the biggest challenges facing disabled gamers is the lack of accessibility
in game design and physical hardware. According to SCOPE UK… [66% of gamers with an impairment or
condition say they face barriers or issues related to gaming.] Some common challenges for disabled
gamers include:

● Limited Input Options: Some games may rely heavily on specific control schemes, making it difficult for players with mobility
issues to participate
● Inadequate Visuals: Games often rely on complex graphics and visuals, making it challenging for players with visual
impairments to navigate and enjoy the gaming experience.
● Poor Audio Accessibility: Games frequently use audio cues for crucial information, disadvantaging players with hearing
impairments.
● Text Size and Fonts: Small text sizes and hard-to-read fonts can be challenging for players with visual impairments.
● Lack of Cognitive Accessibility: Some games may be too fast-paced or have complex mechanics, making it difficult for
players with cognitive disabilities to engage.
● Online Features and Social Interaction: Many games include online multiplayer features and social interaction components
that may not be accessible to players with certain disabilities.
● Inclusive Representation: Games often lack diverse and inclusive representation, both in characters and storylines.
Addressing these issues requires a concerted effort from game developers, designers, and the gaming
community. Creating more inclusive and accessible games not only benefits players with disabilities but
also enhances the overall gaming experience for everyone. Many organizations and advocates are pushing
for increased awareness and action in this area to ensure that gaming becomes more accessible to all.

## TARGET AUDIENCE/CURRENT SITUATION

The target audience will be Disabled Gamers/Veterans, Companies working on tech for the Disabled, and
just anyone who wants to learn more. The hope would be for disabled gaming to become more noticed
and a much bigger community and people who will make gaming better for the disabled. People are
dealing with the problem of accessibility in games by increasing attention to the issue forming
organizations and becoming advocates. Many organizations and advocates are pushing for increased
awareness and action in this area to ensure that gaming becomes more accessible to all. This advocacy
has made the gaming industry take steps to make games more inclusive for all players by trying to address
accessibility challenges, to ensure that all people can enjoy gaming. Progress is being made, but more
work needs to be done to ensure that all players can fully participate in and enjoy gaming.

## CURRENT COMPETITION AND WHY MY SITE DIFFERS

The current competition for the Website is other Gaming Websites and Gaming Charities. A few
examples would be PC Gamer, IGN, and Games Radar. GameSpot, Polygon, AbleGamers, and SpecialEffect. The
key elements that set the website apart from the competition are it will be disabled gamer-focused, it will
have a gamer spotlight, gamer interviews, and new disabled gaming technology as well as news. There is
no other gaming website that is solely focused on the disabled except for the gaming charities but they are
focused on getting funding for disabled gaming equipment, not news, interviews, and explaining all the
tech available and I want to make this a real company.

## PROJECT

The scope of this project is to create and develop a disabled gaming website titled Enabled Gaming. This
website will not be your typical gaming website, instead, it will be about gaming for disabled individuals.
This includes information on Assistive tech, game options, and more.

## SPECIFICATIONS/VISUAL CONCEPT

The size of the website will be set at 3 different sizes desktop 1920×1080px, mobile 360×640px, and tablet
601×962px. Margins will be set to 20-30px throughout most of the website. I plan to incorporate a grid
layout for this site as it will give me more flexibility and placement options. The website will include a total
of 5-6 pages to allow organization and flexibility of information. Most of the websites will have a header and
footer. Other specifications may be added as the design and mockups become visible. Font size will be
about 10-16px throughout the body with headings being about 25-40px. The font size will differ for the logo
and tagline. The font style is still being decided but it will have a gaming feel to it. Use colors, typography,
and images that are playful but also keep a professional look. I would like to incorporate fun shapes as
long as they keep a professional feel. The design will be quite colorful and full of images/illustrations. The
header and footer will have a gaming-related design. There will be colored sidebars throughout. News and
information will be on the front page, as well as the logo.

## MISSION STATEMENT

Enabled Gaming’s mission is through a commitment to disabled individuals and technology, we aim to
provide information about Assistive technology, Game options, other disabled gamers, and feedback on
options that could be incorporated into games, to consumers and game and assistive technology
developers by providing a central place for all things disabled gaming.

## CONCLUSION

I believe that my interface can solve the problem stated above because it will help spread the word about
disabled gaming and hopefully get more people to understand that there truly is a need for accessibility in
games. I hope to provide information to game development teams and game studio executives so that they
can incorporate disability-friendly options into games.
